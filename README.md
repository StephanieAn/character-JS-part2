Character Manager project
==========================

What's the purpose of this project 
-----------------------------------
After we've made some exo in JS, the purpose of this project was to use some JS code.

In this website, we have use an API that's the same for all the groups. The issue is we can't delete all the data in the API. 

### 1. The HTML part:
This wasn't an issue. It was modified all along the project (to add some elements or to deleted some others).

### 2. The CSS part:
We have worked with some **lorem Ipsoum** cart to make the styling. After the grobal design was correct, we passed to the JS. When we have finished the JS and it worked fine, we made the details of the design (such as the countable character on the manager character page, the responsive part, etc.).

### 3. The JS part: 
The biggest part of this project was the JavaScript code. We prefer to separate the script in three (one for each page). 

Adrien worked on the main page JS:
* Fetch the DataBase;
* Cloning and filling the template to display the character;
* When we use the button **See character**, we have display the values of the object's keys;
* The search bar code.

Stephanie worked on the single character page: 
* Fetch the DataBase;
* Filling the HTML elements with the data of the character;
* The "Update" button;
* The "Delete" button.

The little modification of these two pages was made in a team effort. 

For the last page (the manager character page), we have chosen to make all the JS on the same script.js. To update and to add a character in the DataBase, the JS script is in the same file
We've worked together:
* The way to upload/to add a picture;
* The way to add a character;
* The way to update a character;
* The character counting;
* The "Save" button;
* The "Delete" button.
